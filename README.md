This project was developed as part of my Master's thesis in Computer Science and Media in collaboration with the Ravensburger Spieleverlag. The goal is to gain an overview of the global board game market and to uncover thematic backgrounds and hidden trends within it.

### Project Description

The project is divided into three main components.

#### Game Pipeline
The first component is the Game Pipeline, consisting of Python scripts that scrape, transform, and store board game data from the web. The data is sourced from [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com) and [Spiel des Jahres](https://spiel-des-jahres.de).

#### Topic Modeling
The second component analyzes and categorizes the game data using [BERTopic](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html) to identify underlying themes.

#### Dashboard Application
[Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) serves as the foundation for a web application that allows further analysis of the collected and processed data. Specific analysis pages are available, featuring graphs and filters for exploration.
